You have installed the package, great! 

Unfortunatly it may not look amazing enough yet, so here's a guide!

1. Go to Assets>Import Package>Effects and get that stuff.

2.Go to the asset store and find something called :Post Processing Stack. 

3. Now you can go to main camera and insert the "missing script" to get things going.



If you see any seams, that is likely cause of how Baked Lighting gets broken when importing a package.

In order to fix this, just clear baked data and bake it again.

It takes about 3 to 10 minutes.
